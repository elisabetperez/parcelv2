# How to... host a site using Github Pages and Parcel</h1>
## Aye mate! If you are here, you want to deploy & publish a site using the free hosting offered by Github and Parcel, the latter as the bundler for all the packages/libraries you use in your site ðŸ˜Š
Look no more, as here I've written a simple guide to use Parcel to bundle all those libraries and push the built pages on the gh-pages branch of your github repo. You can find the entire guide here: [Click Me!](https://www.matteogregoricchio.com/articles/github-pages-hosting-with-parcel.html)

This repository is a model you can fork and download.

It contains a Hello World Site published on GitHub Pages, using the tutorial instructions. ðŸ˜Š
